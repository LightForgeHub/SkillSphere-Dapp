# SkillSphere

**SkillSphere** is a peer-to-peer knowledge marketplace that enables experts to get paid **per minute** for their time through **continuous, trustless payments**.

Instead of hourly invoices, subscriptions, or platform-controlled payouts, SkillSphere allows knowledge seekers to stream payments directly to experts **only while value is being delivered**.

Built on **Stellar + Soroban**, SkillSphere removes intermediaries, reduces platform fees, and expands global access to expertise.

---

##  Why SkillSphere Exists

The global consulting and knowledge economy is broken:

* Experts wait days or weeks to get paid
* Platforms take **20–30% commissions**
* Users must trust upfront payments for uncertain quality
* Micro-consultations (5–20 minutes) are economically inefficient

SkillSphere solves this with **real-time, usage-based payments**.

---

##  What Makes SkillSphere Different

SkillSphere is designed around **continuous value exchange**, not one-time transactions.

### Core Principles

* Pay **only while the consultation is active**
* Funds flow **directly** from seeker to expert
* No subscriptions, no hidden fees
* Blockchain stays invisible to users

---

##  How It Works

1. **Connect**

   * Users and experts connect a Stellar wallet (e.g. Freighter)

2. **Discover**

   * Seekers browse verified experts by skill and availability

3. **Start Session**

   * Funds are locked in escrow
   * Payment begins streaming per second

4. **Consult**

   * Video call or async session
   * Payments stream continuously

5. **Settle Automatically**

   * Session ends → stream stops
   * Expert keeps exactly what they earned
   * Unused funds are refunded instantly

---

##  Why Streaming Payments Matter (Wave Alignment)

SkillSphere depends on **continuous payments** because:

* Experts should be paid **as time passes**, not later
* Seekers should stop paying instantly if value stops
* Micro-consultations become viable (5–10 minutes)
* Trust is enforced by protocol, not platform policy

This makes SkillSphere a **natural fit for Wave-style monetization**.
