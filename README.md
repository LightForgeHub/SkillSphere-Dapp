# 🌐 SkillSphere

**SkillSphere** is a decentralized marketplace for expertise. It connects specialists, creators, and professionals directly with knowledge seekers for micro-consultations, mentorship, and skill exchange.

By using blockchain technology, SkillSphere removes traditional intermediaries, reduces high platform fees, and ensures that experts are paid instantly and securely for their time.

###  Overview

SkillSphere reimagines the "Expert-as-a-Service" model. Whether you are a developer looking for a 15-minute code review, a creator seeking branding advice, or a specialist offering niche consulting, SkillSphere provides the infrastructure to book, conduct, and pay for that expertise in a peer-to-peer environment.

###  Key Features

* **Expertise Marketplace:** A global directory where users can discover and book specialists based on verified on-chain reputations.
* **Tokenized Time:** Experts can mint their availability as digital units (Time Tokens), allowing users to "buy" and "trade" consultation slots.
* **Direct P2P Payments:** Frictionless payments made directly from seeker to expert using the Stellar network.
* **Secure Escrow:** Smart contracts handle the payment logic, ensuring funds are only released once the consultation or service is completed.
* **On-Chain Reputation:** A transparent rating and review system that is immutable and verified by the blockchain.
* **Content Monetization:** Tools for experts to lock premium educational resources or "Knowledge NFTs" behind their expertise profile.
